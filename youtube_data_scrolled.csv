6,8kCMHA,4,Lo-fi,"Lo-fi study music_EtD7","thank you guys for 1.000.000 views, absolutely mindblowing how well our music is received, especially because we tried to get feedback on our tracks from bigger names, and somehow they were never happy with our music, so instead of trying to make them happy, we went our own way and hope we can make a bit of a difference. Btw. Our new album is almost done -scheduled for early January - so thank you everyone for just listening, means a lot to us!

I was astonished how he was allowed to do that during the match and I kept telling everyone that this is foul play. And he was being coached all the f***g time! Glad that Fed beat him in that match.",548

She stated that she would never do it again. And in 2023, I don‚Äôt believe she ever did that again.",294
67,syg1xTNT9b0,1,Sports,"tennis top moments","The other dirty play is when the ball touches a part of your body, and you don't concede the point. It was so cool during the 2023 US Open doubles final when Bopanna stopped the point and conceded the point, but no one else on the court realized it.",85

69,syg1xTNT9b0,1,Sports,"tennis top moments","The worst case I've ever saw was Anabel Medina Garrigues vs Serena Williams in 2013. Anabel during the changeover breaks would demand the balls from the ball boys and then purposely rub them and destroy them on her racquet. She did this during a clay court tournament so the balls would break down and play even slower and make it harder for Serena to hit winners against her.",128

I wonder if he just trying to flatten down the fluff on the ball to hit the serve faster. I‚Äôve heard players complain that the Australian open balls fluff up too much and as a server you definitely don‚Äôt want that. A touch of moisture and rubbing would definitely flatten the fluff for that first serve.",88

77,syg1xTNT9b0,1,Sports,"tennis top moments","If these are the 8 dirtiest plays you could find it says a lot for tennis.  3 of these weren't even bad plays, they were bad calls (judgment) from the umpire and had nothing to do with the players.  And 1 of them was Djokovich turning his back to an incoming smash.

The only shocking 1 here was Gaston's action, which rightly got him a huge fine.",140

79,syg1xTNT9b0,1,Sports,"tennis top moments","Norrie was not intentional. Djoko was way too close to the net and still moving in the middle. For a high volley players are used to hitting in the middle in case the ball was out.",38
80,syg1xTNT9b0,1,Sports,"tennis top moments","One I remember very vividly was when Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez played Serena at the French Open years back. Maria hit a drop shot, Serena came to net and hit a backhand that actually bounced off Maria‚Äôs arm, but Maria won the point because it ‚Äúappeared‚Äù to be that Maria hit a winning volley (a bad call from the umpire, but Maria also acted as if she didn‚Äôt do anything wrong if my recollection is correct). Serena was NOT happy about that‚Ä¶.she was ready to throw hands with Maria in that locker room ",11

One of the nicest women I have ever met in my life, always positive, always smiling. I got caught in the Philippines during the pandemic; was expecting to be there for three months, ended up staying there for fourteen months. Also got caught in typhoon Odette. Part of my accommodation was destroyed, a steel beam hit my head and fractured my skull. 

Also, I was without phone, electricity and running water for three months. And I ran out of money. Survived on eating rice and chilli corned beef once a day, and also assisted citizens with the damage from the typhoon. At no stage did I see ANYBODY moping around and feeling sorry for themselves. I get pissed off in Australia when people complain about things like how much unemployment benefits they get paid.

I would like to send them all the the Philippines for a month, see if they can survive (probably not). I learnt to appreciate even the most basic things in life. I thank the Filipino people, they actually helped me to appreciate life more, even the most basic things. Can't wait to go back.",69

I was one of the thousands who graduated with BSN and left for my American dream in the 70s. One thing I need to drop as a nuance is that not all parts of the Philippines have the same social and cultural ethos. We‚Äôre separated by islands and these islands are lumped into six regions by the federal government . And each region is as different in language and culture from the next. Even the food you‚Äôre eating is Greek to us depending on where a native is born and raised. I was born I a rural town of Iloilo province in Panay Island in the Bisayan region in the middle of the country. Ive never eaten the food you‚Äôre showcasing and have tried. We have totally different dishes growing up. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere in Manila area except for visits. We have over 200 vernaculars so educating us with Tagalog as our national  language came  handy and during my elementary years adding English in our curriculum as the third language gave people like me the advantage when I came to the US. My own progenitors on both sides are 75% Spanish and the rest are Malayan and Chinese. We were raised with elders speaking a mixture of Spanish and our Bisayan vernacular. So it‚Äôs appropriate to say that Filipinos come in all shades of culture language and world views. We however share our love of country, patriotic ideals, and a nationalistic spirit when we are confronted with global competitions and aspirations. Thank you for making this video. Still you need to visit other regions to show full context.",46

1099,LbizY-Nbv9A,2,Documentary,"History documentaries","Andy, your recent journeying is exciting bro  It's really not that weird or hard to consider "pug pug" safe, especially given the ways in which it is re-worked. This is going to sound like a weird reference, but, especially after I had significant rendezvous with "sacred earth fungi" when I was away studying in Oregon, I was sort of re-awakened to what I think is universal, root, human "genius" or just natural understanding. Culturally, modern humans tend to get very conditioned to be in awe of the modern cultural "artifacts" being generated around them, and accept some sense of mystery as to how those things are produced, assuming that "experts" and "professionals" and even institutions populated by them, are producing things we couldn't do ourselves. Somehow my experiences with the mushroom melted that away, making more basic dynamics of nature clear, as well as the understanding of how we ourselves can engage with nature and produce things, where the real thresholds or barriers are, if any. This definitely relates to microbiology as well, relieving inherent fear of bacteria or fungi. Printed expiration dates don't matter anymore. Just look and smell. We can pretty much assume all microbes are obliterated via high heat, natural chemicals like acetic acid as you mentioned, oils, etc... The only question then, is if fermentation occurred before killing off the microbes, and if through that fermentation any unsavory or even dangerous chemicals were generated, but as far as transferrence of living microbes, and risk of infection.... unlikely. Then of course the whole subject of immune system making mere exposure not necessarily a problem. Filipino people, are definitely mushroom people. I think we all are, but Filipinos have had perhaps more active symbiosis with the mushrooms through history, and to this day. Drop all cultural facades... Filipinos are genius/adaptive souls. Mexicans are similarly so, and also have extensive, exceptional history with the mushrooms. I am not advising people to go eat psilocybin mushrooms but I think they are significant and actually factor into all of this more than people typically recognize or talk about. EDIT: I guess another simple way to put it is this: "looking past the presented context that something came from a dumpster, and looking through to whether or not that material is ACTUALLY compromised or actually still okay and valuable, is sort of what this is about." Not needing something to come in a box or from a fancy/clean company/institution, in order to recognize what it is and what can be done with it.",9

also: i really, really appreciate the color scheme of this video. the purples and blues are much easier for my eyes - a lot of lofi videos will use bright orange, yellow and red - and those hurt to look at even for only a minute or two. i hope this video stays up forever. i‚Äôll probably be listening to it often.

thanks 

and for anyone reading this comment, i hope you‚Äôre having a good day / night / whatever it is where you are. remember to drink water, eat something (even if it‚Äôs only something light / small), take your meds, and get plenty of rest. don‚Äôt be hard on yourself. every single day you wake up is a W, and every day you get through is another W. that‚Äôs 2 wins per day. they stack up after a while 

for my fellow spoonies (and anyone else dealing with a long term illness): i‚Äôm proud of you for making it this far - and no matter how bad the symptoms get, you are NOT a burden. you deserve love and respect, always.

1326,n61ULEU7CO0,4,Lo-fi,"Lo-fi hip-hop beats","To everyone who's studying with this music:

Checklist: 

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate



‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time



‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late-night study session, you won't wake up anyone



‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.



‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone, a few pens, paper, or whatever you need.Ô∏è



‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heating pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 





Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 

You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book.



I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight

Some personal inspiration for making this video came from: Carl Sagan's Cosmos (Encyclopedia Galactica), the movie Contact, works by Brian Cox, and the tv shows Westworld and The Expanse.



New Project: This is something I've wanted to start for a number of years, creating an Encyclopedia of the Future. A collection of entries, defining future technology in the areas of space habitation, space engineering, biotechnology, cyber society, A.I. robotics, regenerative medicine, and much more. 



The first volume contains 31 entries with illustrations. It is a large ongoing project, with additional volumes to be published that will complete the final Encyclopedia.

We have enough rovers and orbiters that we understand a lot about Mars that gives us more information than we have of some of Earths environments. There will always be doubters, but the announcement was made after a decade of research. It could be wrong, but the people who publish these papers can have their careers ruined by publishing data without absolute certainty and was peer reviewed. From what I understand the meteorite is just one of over a dozen that have come from Mars. The largest impact basin is the Borealis impact that covers 40% of Mars. It would be a statistical impossibility for the pieces of Mars to not be deposited onto our planet. It‚Äôs ether same in reverse. Once we start exploring Mars, we‚Äôll find pieces of Earth there. It is only a matter of time. I'm confident that will not be the most surprising discovery we will find. I cannot definitively say one way or the other, but I have seen the data, and it is confirmed 10x‚Äôs over by some of the smartest people on the planet at NASA & ESA. In the end it is what you believe and the confidence you have in our independent agencies. I believe in the future we will find house and city-size chunks of Mars here.

It was a small Methodist university, and the new students were given such horrible 'advice' from the RA's, such as, "Leave your door open! You never know who you might meet!" I had to tag along on these tours, as the new students were walked around the campus and shown where the buildings were. When they were told to leave their doors wide open, I would interject, "Yes! You can meet your r*pist this way, since folks like to prop open the exterior doors, which allow ANYONE to walk in...not just students. So if you want some guy to get to know you in the carnal way, leave your door open!" I was reported for telling students to keep their room doors closed and locked for their own safety. I'd passed out my own cellphone number to students, so if they drank too much, or if their driver was drunk or high, or if some girl's date was getting too handsy, they can call me, even if I was at home, and I would come get them and take them back to campus. I was threatened with being fired, if I ever drove another student. The college would prefer their students driving drunk, than have a security officer drive the student (in case I wrecked and they decided to sue.) The president of the college told the parents, "Your child will drink, smoke pot and sleep around. Don't get upset, it's all a part of the college experience."

It could be that I am expecting too much from them.  I hope never to see, " Ryan Gosling Eaten Alive By Giant Shark" , only to learn that it  was Ryan Gosling,  wild life photographer,  consumed by Great White Shark on the rampage.

It's terrible he was killed, but he went into a harsh environment with the intention to kill a moose. We'll, a moose wasn't what he ran into.  I say, no harm no foul and let the cubs be.

Even if Chandler wasn't caught, his life won't be the same, he will never succeed in anything no matter how hard he tries.

Everything he touches will turn to dust. I wonder what's going in his mind during the Interrogation. Does he looks and act like someone who just lost his parents in the most gruesome way??

It has similar square joints and open parrallel  gaps, and squared ledges and squared blocks of stone downslope in very similar appearance to much of  Gornya Shorea, albeit in a more miniature way.  It was formed by epic flowing water and nobody claims it was man made. SImilarly the Shawangunks of the Catskill Mountain's eastern most range are likewise similar in the their jointing and block formation and fallen squared blocks and ledges, but on a larger scale than Gornaya Shoria,  Again they are rarely claimed to be man made.

2105,IXyMi76Z1Xw,2,Documentary,"History documentaries","My feeling on this, is that the heavy base layers are geological formations, probably dropped and shaped by moving glaciers. 
Thousands of years after the Ice age ended,the 400 ton block, Baalbek style wall, was built by men, using methods in advance of what history books credit them with.
Almost certainly, not just stone tools.
They could be the descendants of those earlier people who survived the Ice age in that region..
They would have had developed cranes, and metal tools by then, An understanding of leverage, the construction of ropes and pulleys, possibly chains.
Also a large healthy population of organized and determined men and women,evidence of their passing should be in the soil within a couple of miles.
Even at that, cutting,moving and accurately placing a 400 ton block is hard to fathom for a modern work crew, let alone one which existed over 10 thousand years ago.


They could have shaped the Ice age base blocks using similar methods for creation of more regular looking elements..
I think the rocks strewn around the site, are not caused by an explosion, but are probably the remains of work sites, where they carved the giant stones.

As for the age of the site, I would say it is probably younger than 100,000 years old, and closer to the end of the Ice age, probably a millennium or two after the Ice sheet dropped the supermassive base stones.
I guess the base stones could have been  formed millions of years ago geologically..and then shaped by man, and built upon around 11,000 years ago.

Not an expert, this isn't definitive,Just my feeling on it.",4

However such videos only show you the surface. I'm reading comments of people who've visited Albania and were extorted by the police. That's gonna put people off. No matter where people go, the #1 thing they care about is their safety. Colombia, Mexico, Brazil etc are all popular tourist destinations but one thing that has repelled some people from going back to those places is the crime and the risk of being abducted. Albania seems nice but there's something sketchy about it. I mean if you're just gonna spend a few days then you'll probably be okay but staying long term? I don't know. And it's not just Albania but anywhere in eastern Europe can be sketchy. This is not to say western Europe is perfect.

Well, many Serbs were going to Albania for summer vacation during COVID-19 (it was easier and cheaper), it's not far so why not.
Some of them would come back and say it was great, others would come back and say it is like Montenegro, but less crowd and fewer buildings (what means better). Some of them didn't like it for some reason - it is very similar as going anywhere else.
There is no organised online propaganda against Albanian tourism. Maybe there are some trolls that like to make such comments without even visiting or going there but they would do similar things for everything.

However, I found myself drawn to your ocean research and the amazing activities covered by the research teams; sent me back 45 years to whale watch trips along the Baha coast and San Ignacio Lagoon [foregive me; those were the days!] The free driver accompanying the humpback whales was a truly serene experience.

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate 

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time 

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more
with headphones because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone 

‚Ä¢ Tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well 

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff: your laptop/tablet/ phone, 
a few pens, paper or whatever you need 

Remember to take breaks whenever you need along with moving your body around a bit so you're not always sitting! Have a beautiful day/night ",3

When stone age humans made it to China they possessed the same neolithic tech package as the other human cultures coming from Africa at the time. After that, those stone tools largely DROP OUT of the archaeological record in China with no documented explanation, and yet they not only kept pace as a protoculture, they were soon one of the most advanced early human civilizations, even without stone tools and long before the advent of the iron age. Total Ancient Aliens kinda stuff.

Only it's not. They found bamboo. It was sturdy, it was versatile, it was renewable and far less difficult and dangerous to work with-- and was biodegradable, leaving little to nothing in the fossil record unless conditions were right, which means that for all the good it did the ancient Chinese it confounded archaelogists for hundreds of years because they weren't asking the right questions and they were making assumptions based on what they knew. Even those with minds open enough to consider things like subarctic pyramids need to consider that perhaps they are making assumptions based on what they think they know, or what they think they know better.

Ancient aliens and high tech precursor civilizations are fun on paper, as pulp sci-fanstasy, but early humans were a lot smarter and more resourceful than we give them credit for. Apply Occam's razor with this stuff, please, for the love of God (or for the lack of one, if that's your leaning.)",29

Checklist: 



‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate



‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time



‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone



‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.



‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.



‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 





Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 

You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book. (¬¥‚ñΩ` É‚ô°∆™)



I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight 



And remember if you're going through anything hard, I'm here to listen and talk to you, ik I'm just a stranger but I'm human too <3 you can reply or we can chat on discord if you're not confident talking here. ‚ô°

From working, all week, and stuff, then needing to do stuff on the weekend, just couldn't get the time. But I got this on iTunes, and I love this movie. It's a ton of fun, and honestly, the villain wasn't to bad, Darben (Dar-ben or Dar Ben), fuck it, it's something like that, she's a decent villain. She's not Loki or Thanos or anything. This movie is a ton of fun.

I think it's got great visuals, and the action is great. The suits were all great, like, especially the Captain Marvel suit at the start, and I liked the new Ms. Marvel suit. The only suit I didn't particularly care for was the second Captain Marvel suit for the end, I didn't like that suit. The acting is great by everyone, especially Iman Vellani, she carried this movie lol. I was also so happy to see Kate Bishop back in this. This movie had a ton of awesome ideas, and it was cool to see. It really does suck this movie bombed, cuz it didn't deserve to. I have no right to bitch about that cuz I didn't see it in the theaters. But I really did want to. I'm gonna buy the 4k of this, it's great and worth getting a physical copy.",1

"The Marvels" opened in theaters recently to mixed reviews from critics and fans alike. One can only wonder if Sammy's disappointment in the movie will affect its performance at the box office.

4278,7e2ZamUpI,4,Lo-fi,"Lo-fi hip-hop beats_l","To everyone who's studying with this lofi mix, here's a little checklist:

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate 

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time 

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more
with headphones because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone 

‚Ä¢ Tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well 

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff: your laptop/tablet/ phone, 
a few pens, paper or whatever you need 

Remember to take breaks whenever you need along with moving your body around a bit so you're not always sitting! Have a beautiful day/night ",13

The unfinished obelisk, as has been witnessed, was initially formed using the keel method. That is to leave a small strip under the stone to be excavated then to cut openings along the length if the keel so ropes could be fitted. Then either to secure one end of the rope to the upper bedrock and thx other to a team of oxen to pull as the keel was cut further or between opposing teams of oxen. Such method would lift the obelisk out of the pit and then wooden planks could be placed across the pit and sledges brought under the obelisk, to transport away from the quarry. No cranes needed. While the rope would initially stretch, once the stretch was done the stone would rise due to the rope straightening.",2

To begin with Bixby 'cause it's easier to drag the barrel with a windless than it is to push a barrel.
As long as the dragging is actually rolling. Moreover, you can either move large stones or a sit a set amount of small stones. That are rough, hune and then finished in place. In addition, why make a multiplied machine out of copper Subway when you can drag a rope through that same block multiple times by putting flip on the rope.  You can cut marble and not cut rope.

The editing is perfection and you can see this from Enter The Void to Birdman. When the camera feels so light in ETV and then we heavily transition to a man as he moves heavy through the same kind of establishment. And then the pulp fiction scene when you drag it on for a second and the car parks at the perfect beat end. And then putting that sprawling beach scene from Tree Of Life to The Master will always give me chills. And then the transition to Blade Runner and Fight Club made a sense of connected nostalgia.

Checklist: 



‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate



‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time



‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone



‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.



‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.Ô∏è



‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 





Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 

You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book. 



I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight

South America was inhabited by multiple very organised hierarchical societies well advanced in large stone structures and boat building, as can be seen in Peru, Mexico, Ecuador etc etc. It is easy to imagine that they would surley have navigated their way across the Pacific, island hopping westward including Easter island , after all, they had done so all around the South of  America for centuries. It is from this society and culture that many believe that these same South American boat people made it to NZ but were eventually assimilated into the more dominant Polynesian/Asian cultures that were more wood centered societies travelling from the North via ancient Taiwan-Phillipines Asian/Polynesian route which is the conventional and offically accepted theory of the story of NZ , But before that we can't help but wonder about the more sparsely inhabited clues we find such as this wall which points to the older South American travellers that came before them. In other words, todays Maori are the interception of these two cultures and peoples, albeit dominated by the more numerous wood centered culture of the Polynesian people that colonised NZ cica 600 AD..",3

5311,1E5Hyg37dRU,2,Documentary,"Technology documentaries","We begin in Shuanglou, China üá®üá≥  

The village wells have dried up. Been dry for at least three years.  We don‚Äôt even know what that means. We turn on the faucet, the shower, the garden hose; water  always comes out. So, please, sit back and at least consider being less wasteful with your water after watching this. 

Here‚Äôs how the people of Shuanglou deal with having no water based on one household: Lin  Guang uses one pot of water as follows: for cooking, then it‚Äôs reused for washing, then for the pigs. And replenishing the water supply?  Since the village wells ran dry,  it‚Äôs a long trek to a remote source hidden in the mountains between rocks that requires dexterity to get at it.

The trip back? Schlepping gallons of water in plastic  containers. 

What‚Äôs next: 

USA, East Coast: We go to the windiest research station on Earth ( now that‚Äôs got to be seriously windy. Have you ever been Lakeside, Chicago?) for hurricane research in Point Washington. Its unique geographical location makes it perfect to research all sorts of wind and weather related stuff. A windbreaker won‚Äôt cut it here though. Wind chill factor remember?  Oh, and hold on tight. Chairs, tables, people..have been known to be blown away  

On to Germany and an island called Usedom.
The Nazis erected an industrial warehouse; an army research center that tested rockets and  missiles. 

Now, it belongs to that glorious tourist attraction phenomenon called ruins decay sightseeing (it‚Äôs called something else but we‚Äôre not allowed to use that word here). It‚Äôs not a tourist attraction per say because you need a permit to go inside. But it‚Äôs creepily cool and worth a visit. Apply for a permit first. Allied forces targeted the area, and the Nazis did try to blow it up as the Russians were approaching. But it didn‚Äôt work. Our luck.  History stands with a terrifying shadow. 

Dhaka, Bangladesh üáßüá© a  seriously crowded city with a population of 14,000,000. To put that amount of people in one place in context: Population density  over one thousand people per square km. Japan, also a very densely populated country, has 335 people square kilometer. Crowded is an understatement. 

One of the main sources of transportation are bike rickshaws. And rather centrally located, the bicycle rickshaw graveyard. Lots of tossed rickshaws  and we see how some people‚Äôs trash becomes something useful for someone else. 

Poland üáµüá± : a small town there is home to a gigantic statue  of Pope John Paul II. We visit the workshops that produce other kinda creepy oversized characters. 

We bookend today‚Äôs episode with another trip back to China, near Beijing. 

A village. Labeled the richest in the world? This proves once again: there are seriously oddball places you‚Äôve never heard about. It‚Äôs like a Disneyland for Capital Communists. Chinese propaganda blares out of speakers between 8am and 5 pm. Now, if that doesn‚Äôt drive you nuts, the rules and regulations will. 

Everything‚Äôs ‚Äúperfect‚Äù and obviously perfect means something different for different people. Yeah. It‚Äôs somewhat of a freak show. 

Weird and wonderful MYSTERY  STORIES. Mysterious because people somehow make these places work. Sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a bad way, but they always work. 

Before we go:

We‚Äôd like to remind you about our donation drive to provide 5 wells   for 1 village. 
Heres the link to help: https://bit.ly/2ZlGggq In a nutshell: 5000 is the goal. With that money five wells for a village. I think anyone who regularly watches our docs knows how important access to clean water is. Please help if you can #everylittlebithelps",215

And with the lower class at half of the crew of 350 well bred sons and daughters of royalty only the ne leader could order his sister the only Doctor to solve this problem. But even as smart as she was she had no idea on how to create a smart Human replacements for their lower class  much less how to teach them to propagate.

What if they did not look or act as they have been portrayed and taught? Humanoids have been on this planet for tens of millions of years. So why are the people of the recent past portrayed not much different really then those of millions of years ago? It is highly problematic that theory is taught as fact based on little to no evidence but only supposition. Look at tall the modern diversity that exists and continues to be formed. Would that not have been the case long ago as well. I also do not think it out of the question that there may have been colonizers from elsewhere, other worlds, just as there have been and still are form other lands on the planet. That these would mix, could mix, suggests that humanoids (for lack of a better general term) are not limited to this one planet. They would have brought with them plants and animals as well. The stories also tell of this having happened to help rebuild on this world after some major cataclysm. Which means that life on this world is compatable with life elsewhere at least in some places to some degree or else those plants and animals would not have survived and thrived and still remain today even if changed over time. Things are in stories because there is a root of fact and something that continues to resonate so that the stories are preserved and passed on long long after the original events that inspired the stories took place. Stories last far longer then any civilization or culture and pass information from one culture to another far easier. Stories are like building in stone, it lasts.",6

5717,eGlENL2o,2,Documentary,"Nature documentaries_j7","The Vltava has been inspiration for poets, architects and composers. Along its riverbanks, numerous historical sites bear witness to the long and rich history of the country. And it is spanned by 18 bridges while running through the 'Golden City' of Prague - the country's capital with its sea of golden roofs and walls made of yellow shimmering sandstone.

On most of its course, the VItava runs quietly along, but every now and then it reveals its wild character, bursting its banks and thus in places being tamed by a unique cascade of reservoirs and dams. But apart from that, it runs freely in its natural riverbed, providing a home for a wide range of wildlife.
Among others, the spotted suslik and penduline tit have settled in, and with a little bit of luck you may even find lynxes and wolves roaming the territory along this exceptional river.",4

It received acclaim for its performances, direction, screenplay, musical score, visual effects, ambition, themes, and emotional weight. It has also received praise from many astronomers for its scientific accuracy and portrayal of theoretical astrophysics. Since its premiere, Interstellar gained a cult following, and now is regarded by many sci-fi experts as one of the best science-fiction films of all time.",12

I never shoot, 'cause to shoot is the buddy of runs.
Beyond the walls of flamingos, life is defined.
I think of trees when I'm in a Boston state of mind.

Hope the runs got some puns.
My tons don't like no dirty buns.
Run up to the ones and get the nones.

What more could you ask for? The beautiful Hoes?
You complain about the heat.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the expose.

I'm rappin' to the Fox,
And I'm gonna move your ox.

Smooth, sweaty, ugly, like a Hood
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a childhood.

I can't take the the heat, can't take the Dogs.
I woulda tried to chuckle I guess I got no frogs.

I'm rappin' to the ox,
And I'm gonna move your Fox.

Yea, yaz, in a Boston state of mind.

When I was young my buddy had an expose.
I waz kicked out without no close.
I never thought I'd see that pose.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my buddy's rose.

An amazing Money is quite the sunny.

The worst thing I did was get into fights at school,   and apparently that was enough to take me out of school from the 6th grade, and store me in a warehouse where we did whatever we had to do to survive until we go tout, I ran away 3 times, but they caught me each time, and threatened me with JDC until I was an adult if I didn't go back. I LOST my childhood to the war on drugs...without even doing drugs once! >< I wasn't locked in prison, but a lot of my meals were the bare minimum of an apple, 1 slice of bread, and 6 ounces of tap water, locked in one of the 3 time out rooms for way over the legal time allowed foir a minor, one time for 72 hours, without seeing anyone but a "councilor" that came in with a rolling chair and interrogated me for an hour a day, for what, I DON'T KNOW! I was scared, lonely, felt abandoned, unloved, unwanted, and they wanted to turn me into a robot...I had top call my best friend, and tell him that I couldn't ever talk to him again, because he was a "druggy friend"...how fkd up and outrageous is that stupidity...I eventually fell in line, and pretended my way out, but never got over the trauma. almost half of the kids I was in there with are dead now, suicide, OD, or otherwise. I turned 14 in there, had no birthday, they tried putting  back in school a year later, and I couldn't relate to any of the kids I met, anyway...I can't imagine even the hell I went thru being as bad as what the adults went thru in prison, if I could be locked up and labeled as a drug addict when I'd never touched a drug at 13 years old, I have no doubt at all, that most of the people being locked away did not deserve what they were dealt. If you think the conservative party, the GOP< republicans, whatever you want to call them...I call them criminals, if you think they've changed, they haven't, they've just gotten much better at hiding what they do under different names, in the same way Straight Inc. changed it's name after being shut down for multiple accounts of child abuse. The right is not a party, it's a cult, a cult of white supremacy praying their way into the deepest pockets of cash money support, and into the most powerful positions in politics. Maybe all this time that these crazy people that claim lizard people run the country are right...but they're  not lizards, they're just very bad people pretending to care, in order to keep you scared...straight into voting for them.",13

Now, as far as I've ever inferred, we call the opposite end of that, Antarctica, solely because it's on the other side or opposite of the Arctic Circle. But what if , long ago, when names were slowly evolving for these land masses, Antarctica got the "Ant" or "Anti" due to the complete opposite climate, lush warm and tropical?

Telling people they could afford to fly around the world to visit any place they wanted for not much more than their weekly wage was a pipe dream, I would have had to save my $18 a week wage for two years to go to the next airport in our State or Nation, to fly was a Wealthy persons transport, normal people could only travel by air if some one paid for them.
Now a few Hundred dollars and you can fly in comfort to Thailand or Philippines and a few dollars more any where else in the world :)
My Wife and I go at least three or four times a year now on cruises or over seas flights for holidays.

The major things to overcome are load compacity and times between launches, so Space X can certainly launch at a much greater payload. Keep in mind.

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate 

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time 

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more
with headphones because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone 

‚Ä¢ Tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well 

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff: your laptop/tablet/ phone, 
a few pens, paper or whatever you need

1.   The map has the modern Chinese name for Canada. Which was first used on maps by Jacques Cartier in 1535 and not used for a large territory for 10 more years or so. How did this get there in the 1400s?
2.  I am fascinated the small characters on the map by the names, they are similar to Japanese Katakana and Chinese phonetic system Zhuyin Fuhao, (introduced 1913) but do not directly match either. Wonder what it is. 
3.  How is a dilapidated section of the fired brick great wall built by the Ming Dynasty (built in only 10 years by the way) a correlation to loosely stacked stoned in CA?   The picture shown - not clear - of a loose stone wall looks similar, but it was unclear and definitely not what they visited. The walls looks like field walls you would find in England or Ireland much more then the Great Wall I visited.
 4. Why would a group exploring the coast in a small expeditionary fleet take the time to go inland and build 50 or 100s of miles of walls they would never return to use?   That makes no sense to me.  

This was interesting but more click bait than real research. I am not a cartographer, nor an expert on historical Chinese, but I am not convinced.",33

First mentioned at the time of Jacob-Israel with his brother Esau moving into the Jordan area and that of the Seirites (Osiris-ites) and Horites (Horus).  Down through time Nabataeans (those black Kushite empire once-pharaohs of Upper Egypt), then slaves in the times of Moses, they exited Egypt with the Israelites as part of the "mixed multitudes" of other prior Sea Peoples, Hyksos (Eastern European Hebrews), Habiru (Western European Hebrews) of 1620-1207/1206 BCE.  These blacks with their Kushite capital of Napata, gave the name of their existence to this region of the Wilderness of Zin, as a Nabataeans.

It becomes most-noted in the times of 69/70 - 600s CE, that the refugee Christian population fleeing the Roman conquest of the Pharisees (Persian socialist jewry), that this Christian colony stayed in this area during this period, until the rise of Islam and Muhammed.

Petra is a bastardized word which in this period of this Christian kingdom and region was Pen Dragon, or Ibn Dragon, shortened down to Petra.  Petra is not a word meaning rose-red color (of the region's stones).

The actual modern embellishments of the (said) Petra Treasury building were constructed during the times of these Christian kings.  Petra is more than 2 1/2 miles in length, of which modern tourist barely see 1/2 at most of the whole community complex.

I often talk to 'myself', which is more of a mode in which I isolate perspectives, let them 'talk' while keeping other perspectives still for a moment. While one perspective is talking, reactions from other perspectives occur. I feel those reactions, but tell them to hold it for a moment. it is like queueing them up. When the isolated perspective is done expressing, other 'perspectives' can react or question. Often the very first counter expressions are conflicting. I (the overall observer perspective not getting lost in any of the other perspectives) oversees that this 'conversation' between perspectives is executed by some rules: listen to each other, take in the others perspective honestly without enforcing your own, and always honestly express your own reaction or perspective. Then kind of magically these perspectives often work out a unified understanding in which both perspectives were heard, understood, and find a way forward together, without compromise. Which one could interpret as the entropy of the system just got lowered. 

If you would ask me who I am? I am 'that', a process that is unattached to any story, observing mental processes and mediating where needed. Also I would say that this unattached mediating I is absent most of the time.

Fun fact: These communications rules can be applied to me and other people, between these mental perspectives, and me and other beings I encounter during (lucid) dreams (from which I really learn life lessons now and then).

So for me that is where the I dissolves, as these communication principles and effects happen and can be applied on different levels: more outside of me (other people) and more inside of me (my own perspectives and then deeper: the dream beings whilst the physical body is sleeping).",2

7734,1oBE2Wr7kpk,2,Documentary,"Science documentaries","One does not need to perform a callosotomy on one's brain to realize just how fractured one's "self" or one's "persona" is. Good old Lucid Dreaming is a very powerful demonstration of this fact. When one lucid dreams, - one has a very specific set of memories which are relevant in that dream, or that part of a dream, but which doesn't go beyond it. In such a dream you know, for example where the "dream street" you're walking on leads, what is behind the next corner, which bus to take, etc. And yet, - you would not be able to recall what day of the week it is in the waking world, or what your schedule is like on the coming weekend. These memories are unavailable, because being able to recall them would interfere with memory renewal and consolidation. In a sense - the brain gives itself a simulated "conscious experience" , a sort of a sandbox or playpen, so that the unconscious parts of it could self-organize effectively. You are able to "recognize" the people from your dreams whom you never met in real life, even how you behave in these dreams is often inconsistent with your behavior in the waking world. The only thing you know with near complete certainty in a lucid dream is that it's a dream, but even then, part of you doubts that, and this is why jumping from rooftop to rooftop can be so frightening for a novice. But you are never a "complete you" in your dreams, in fact you are never a "complete you" in the waking life, the difference merely is, that in waking life, - your experience of your persona is more seamless, more integrated, and that in waking world - most of your experiences are not self-generated (plenty of solipsists would beg to differ on this one though). My own opinion on the larger issue (and not just mine, many neuroscientists lean this way too) is that the human Complex Abstract Awareness (what most people refer to as "waking consciousness") is the act of brain's self-deception. Your ability to behold the entire worlds populated by beings in your head - is self deception, however, because this self deception also just happened to be the most powerful survival and self-reproduction mutation nature has ever come up with, - the environment naturally selected for it. The fact that it involves a great deal of self-deception, unfortunately, also means that we believe in things like the afterlife, bodies and souls, anthropomorphic God and animal-like gods, why we are natural born Cartesian Dualists who group objects and ideas in two totally separate camps, and why we have hundreds of Cognitive Biases and are susceptible to a cornucopia of mental disorders and illnesses.",1

Checklist: 

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone

‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.

‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 



Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 



You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book. 



I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight <33

Checklist: 

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1 liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate



‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time



‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone



‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.



‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.



‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 





Reminder : After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 

You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book.



I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight

AI is the bridge to eventually becoming data/code which is a faraway step to then becoming light, which we will do and must do, in our infinite and inborn quest to merge back with Source, which is pure light. This is crazy, it sounds whacky, even impossible, but zoomed out from a broad perspective - and viewed from a macro, detached, unemotional POV that embraces that evolution of consciousness is the purpose of existence - you can feel into the beauty and benevolence of all of this. Not saying it won't get weird. Oh, it'll get weird. But it's also really beautiful.",18

This ability to use another aggregate copy of someone, say, yourself, would be a true intelligence amplifier. A genius scientist having a discussion with himself, looking for new insights. Brilliant.

8675,47DyjCdwXxs,3,Movie,"Netflix original series","S2 Hopes:
- Catching Aang up on Waterbending, since they cut most of it from S1 
- Repairing the Roku portrayal. They gave his Aang possession part to Kyoshi, removed his warning about the comet, and also portrayed him a bit more like a second Iroh
- Resolving Heibei plotline that was kinda abandoned and left unresolved S1
- Seeding more Lion Turtle foreshadowing throughout S2 so it's not so out of nowhere when it finally happens. The original cartoon barely did any foreshadowing about it outside of that one scroll in the library
- Toph blind jokes are kept in
- Sticking the landing on Zuko Alone
- I see them skipping the Cave of Two Lovers and Avatar Day episodes, which were already partially adapted in S1 with the Omashu and Kyoshi Island stories (where Kyoshi possesses Aang). Serpent's pass might go. Maybe even the whole Appa getting abducted in the desert story, instead being stolen within the Walls to streamline.",124

8717,47DyjCdwXxs,3,Movie,"Netflix original series","I think they'll have it as a time lapse type thing, where Aang mastered water off screen while travelling with group, no doubt they planned ahead and kept hidden footage of things to add in as filler recap to show as Gordon levels up in IRL, which was smart if they planned that far ahead.
They have a great cast and the direction for the most part seems decent enough to offer respect to the original story, I personally loved the ATLA-LA series, watched it 3 times and I loved it.
I think Ep 1 will have them starting off trying to obtain an earth bender now that Aang is proficient in water bending, with flash backs scattered of Aang training with Katara as Gordon was young, which will allow the story to show that they trained after the northern water tribe and Aang has grown while having trained while traveling,
They'll head to Omashi and straight into the Trio of doom.

I don't think people should be comparing the two of them, they both have a place for me, and I'm so happy for the cast and especially for myself, because I loved it and I hope they can find a unicorn for Toph.
I do like the girl for Azula, but trying to find people who can play these larger than life characters is the real challenge, well that and time.",0

It was as if I escaped and traveled, that's when books clicked with me.

FX was once known for amazing shows (i.e. Sons of Anarchy, The Americans etc.). I imagine this retelling of Sh≈çgun will only be loosely based on James Clevell's book. I just hope a great story and characters aren't sacrificed for "ideological elements" which has become too common in shows today and almost ruining them.

#1 The stuntman thing: A cheesy masculine dude from the 80s gets the stubborn girl in the end because he is so dominant and cool ... Yawn.

#2 Godzilla Part 127. Bam bam,  CGI-explosions, CGI-monsters, caucasians and asians do stuff (because target audience) but no story at all. Mew.

#3 The Marvels ... yay, franchise cooking. MacDonald's in RGB.

#4 Wish: Could be cool if you are a 6 year old girl. 

#5 Manodrome: Could be cool if you are an angry middle-aged male from the working class.

#6 Planet of the Apes 4: The first 3 were extremely boring. Might be because it's a remake about talking monkeys.

#7 Shepherd: Whatever ... 

#8 Oh, the hyped cute girl of the year needs to impress a group of gritty lower working class males. How dAngErouS! 

#9 Freud: Well, as German it really annoys me that all Germans and Austrians talk english. I need a therapy too.

#10 Under the whatever: Skipped after 5 seconds. I hate Finding Nemo and all its clones.

#11 My attention span reached its limit. I think I'm sick of american movies anyway. Maybe I'll just watch another Spiegel TV report about pimps and hookers in Hamburg. Try to compete with that, Hollywood! 

#12 Lisa Frankenstein: My 13-year old spoiled girl persona actually likes this. But the real me is just waiting for Dune 2. 

#13: Well, Studio Ghibli movies are usually touching. Probably a good one but I have to Bein the mood. 

#14: X-mas movie: I think I'm not black enough to roast this one. 

#15 Good Burger 2: Same as #14. 

#16: Robot Dreams: I don't know. Does the trailer make me curious? No. You folks can go watch it. I think they make movies for 6-49 year old people. So as a 40-year old I guess I'm already scratching at the borderline. I think I'll just watch Interview with the Vampire on Prime and enjoy those good ol' time classics.",3

9618,WCKKPSP8,4,Lo-fi,"Lo-fi jazz playlists_FI","on Monday this week I've noticed that there wasn't a usual upload by Jazz Hop Cafe (I've been a devoted listener of all its released mixes ever since the pandemics hit in 2020, so I got used to receiving the notification on the first day of the week~ anyways, back to the story). Then today, on Wednesday, my best friend who is leaving the country for good tomorrow came over to my place to spend the time we still had enjoying our usual homebody routine: making coffee with milk, nibbling on home-baked cookies I've prepared last night, and talking a million things a minute, the way we usually jump from topic to topic, letting the conversation flow naturally, then occasionally tracking back and picking up a topic we accidentally abandoned earlier, etc. The way best friends talk.

One of the topics that came up was the uncertain, unknown future. I'm a young mom, she is currently switching jobs (=the reason for her relocation), but it is still not a 100% confirmed deal. We have no idea when the universe will give us another opportunity to have these peaceful, cozy moments of reminiscing over past things, sharing what concerns us now, planning for what we want to achieve in the future. We do know that our bond is solid to withstand long-distance and sending long essay-like letters to each other instead of talking face to face, but we really have no chance of knowing when we will sit in my kitchen in front of each other again, cupping the mugs of coffee in our hands, trying to keep in mind all the things we want yet to discuss, and feeing right where we belong... 

After she left, I went to my comfort place, which is this channel, because the apartment suddenly felt quiet. Uncomfortably so.
And then I see this week's upload from JHC. And the title. 
And it made me feel supported, as if the universe was reassuring me. "where i'm meant to be." No matter the mistakes of the past, no matter the vague lines of the unknown future - right here right now, I'm where I should be, and so is my best friend. I know in my heart that eventually, our paths will cross in a way that will allow us to enjoy each other's company not through the phone screens and messengers but in real life. But it made me feel safe and watched over, to be reminded that right now,

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate 

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time 

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more
with headphones because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone 

‚Ä¢ Tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well 

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff: your laptop/tablet/ phone, 
a few pens, paper or whatever you need 

Remember to take breaks whenever you need along with moving your body around a bit so you're not always sitting! Have a beautiful day/night ",2

        natural resource that, if we protect, also are a picture of the natural ecosystem that is invaluable as a historical marker of the land as it once was, and should be kept.   
       The information also is a high standard which we can use to judge our protection of our natural lands and creatures, and guard these natural resources for how it should be protected, that includes the full range of creatures that deserve protection.   
       Not all areas even try to protect the natural land, thinking a parking lot well maintained, does much for the long term land value.  
       I am most impressed with Great Britain and Europe, and here with this video out of Germany which is a protection of the natural land.     There are too many areas only judging an area on it's wealth.   I certainly enjoy the documentaries produced by Great Britain and here by Germany.   These from Europe are more available than ones in US that are few and far between.  
       Germany, and Great Britain, I salute your documentaries that I could live in.  This is most excellent.      Kudos!",3

* 1972 AFC Divisional Playoff - Ken Stabler runs for 30-yard TD with less than 2:00 to play to give the Raiders a 7-6 lead over the Steelers, just moments before the "Immaculate Reception". Stabler had 93 yards rushing for his CAREER. About as unlikely an occurrence as has ever happened in the NFL.

*1986 Monday Night Football, Oct. 13 - Bengals punter Jeff Hayes runs 61 yards for a TD on a fake punt in the 4th quarter to give the Bengals a come-from-behind, 24-22 win over the Steelers. Greatest fake punt in NFL history.",374

Checklist: 

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1 liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone

‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.

‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, and your pet so you have a study buddy (if you have one)



Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 



You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book. 



I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight

Essentials:

‚Ä¢ Keep a bottle of water, at least 1 liter. Proper hydration enhances cognitive function, aiding concentration. 

‚Ä¢ Keep your charger handy. It's easy to overlook your device's battery levels during study sessions, so ensure it's consistently plugged in. 

‚Ä¢ Wear headphones to minimize background noise, fostering a more focused study environment. If it's late at night, this avoids disturbing others. 

‚Ä¢ Enjoy a cup of tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you alert, while green or black tea can offer a refreshing pick-me-up. 

‚Ä¢ Gather your study/work essentials: laptop, tablet, phone, pens, paper, or any tools you require. 

‚Ä¢ Consider additional comforts like a heating pad, blanket, good lamp, and if you have one, your pet as a study buddy. 



A gentle reminder: Take a break after an hour. Pause the music or switch to a different genre during breaks. Open your window for fresh air, even if it's cold outside. It makes a difference, trust me.



You might also find a short break beneficial; lay your head down for ten minutes or listen to a podcast. If reading, consider an audiobook for a multi-tasking experience. 



Wishing you all a productive day. If not, that's perfectly fine too. Remember to prioritize self-care and try to get a good night's sleep.

As a lover of both traditional Chinese music and the calming vibes of lofi, I am constantly amazed at how this genre connects people from all walks of life. I grew up in a small village in China, where the melodies of the guzheng and the rhythm of drums were part of my daily life. Discovering lofi has been like adding a modern twist to my musical roots.

Inspired by channels like this, I've started experimenting with blending the rich tones of the guzheng with the chill beats of lofi, creating something that feels both new and familiar. It's been a beautiful journey of musical exploration, and I'm excited to share it with others who appreciate the unique tranquility that lofi brings to our hectic lives.

Thanks for being a part of my daily relaxation and inspiration. Keep up the fantastic work ‚Äì your music truly makes a difference! ",7

Checklist: 



‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate



‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time



‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone



‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.



‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.



‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 





Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 

You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book. (¬¥‚ñΩ` É‚ô°∆™)

As far as the moving of large megaliths, there is a YouTube post about a guy who built a replica of Stonehenge using simple tools and techniques. No magic mental stuff, no aliens, just mechanical ingenuity. Example: find the balancing point of a long block, get it to teeter totter on a fulcrum, and you can lift it by rocking back and forth, putting shims on either side of the fulcrum, and you lift it into the air. These blocks in the video were many tons - and the guy did it by himself.

As far as alternate fuels for vehicles: During the 1980's "gas crisis", clubs sprouted up everywhere on how to extend gasoline with water, the "green powder" from coal that when put in with water, you get a flammable liquid that can be a motor fuel. Making butanol by breaking down cellulose with genetically modified e-coli bacteria. That kind of technology was successfully suppressed by the Petroleum establishment.

10880,wqMGC4RbZaI,2,Documentary,"True crime documentaries","CO2 is a light green house gas. There is a limit to how much heat it can trap. Actually the threshold is quite low. There are scientific papers showing this and the evidence. More CO2 over that threshold will not warm global temperatures. Water Vapor is a much higher greenhouse gas. In order to build huge ice sheets at the poles you have to have a warm planet with a lot of water vapor that can fall as precipitation. You can see this effect even during winter seasons. Warmer seasons produce far more snowfalls, colder seasons far less snowfall. This would effect mountain glaciers and snowpacks as well.  More of the planet covered by ocean would expidite evaporation as well would it not helping to build ice sheets at the poles. As the tilt of the planet and as the poles shift would effect the size and placement of ice sheets as well as solar activity and other factors that effect planetary systems. There is evidence of cataclysms in the past. So small changes happening slowly over large periods of time are offset by huge changes happening in a short time. Cataclysms can wipe out so much in a region. People and plants and animals would have to relocate. Such movements of plants and animals is being seen now as things are shifting. The shifting would happen regardless of whether we burn fossil fuels or not. They are natural processes of the planet. Though our activity has put us out of harmony with the rest of nature and made us less able to adapt to changes. No doubt there has been other civilizations before us who ran into the same problem. Though of course major cataclysms that are global in scale would effect any civilization no matter how in harmony with nature and natural processes that they are. There is truely so much we do not know or understand but clinging to views and theories that had been developed on limited evidence does not help us understand new evidences being found.",33

However, despite the global presence of traces of this culture, there is not such a total mixing and distribution of plant and animal species as we have during the period of our global expansion. This is the essential question that no one can or does not want to answer. Undoubtedly, the consequences of the activities of our civilization will be traced for tens of millions of years as absolute evidence of the presence of a developed technoculture, while the presence of an ancient supercivilization is more like local centers that had a common knowledge base, but developed more separately from each other.

11547,RtWgbht6qe8,4,Lo-fi,"Lo-fi jazz playlists","In 2012 I moved to Hirakatashi in the Kansai region. I was a teenager and had no idea what I was in for. At first it was a lot of struggling, learning the language, social etiquette, fitting in. I remember wondering early on if I was really cut out for such a dramatic change. I was afraid.

Very quickly I decided to not let the opportunity go to waste and to put myself out there. I began frequenting a shisha place called Caf√© Istanbul and the owner, Masako, took me under her wing. We'd chat after closing, she was dating a westerner, I was dating a Japanese girl, and we were both lost in the woods and leaned on each other for support. 

If you're ever in Kyoto please pay a visit to Caf√© Istanbul. They're still around with the same owner. Japanese society can be very isolating and lonely, the systems are archaic and bureaucratic, there are a lot of issues with the nation - but the people I met are lifelong friends. By going out and taking some social risks you'll be engraving a tiny fraction of the culture's spirit into your own heart which never leaves you. I don't think it matters if it's Japan, Norway or Zimbabwe. You can always leave a place, but people stick with you, in one form or another.

It was like the grandiosity of hero stuff like armours, and super powers, the cliche jokes were just the shining invitation to relate, connect and learn how to love people who at first seemed to have nothing to do with us. It was a whole fun experience of diving into this different universe where big heros were struggling with the same as you. 

Which made us feel that if they could overcome it or at least keep going, so could we.

Now all we have is that empty and missing feeling on the movies because of the narcissism of the characters, the bad villains and terrible writing and last but absolutely not least the continuous commercialization of heros and the idea of being a hero, inside the MCU!!! What's the point? 

Being a hero has lost it's value and worth. They're invalidating the past heroes and their experiences which felt so real by bringing so many weak and generic aspiring avengers. Do better, marvel. Go back to the good old times.",174

12192,m3ZCXdpRV8o,1,Sports,"cricket compilations","We had a cat on my High School football team. he was 6'8", over 400Lb. But in our case, he had one of those helicopter moms. She was at every practice, bothering the hell out of the coaches at the end of practice...all of that. The effect was, she turned this monster of a kid...into a complete wimp.

Coaches tried to start him anyway, just because of his size. But you would see it in the film every Monday morning. For about one series of downs, the D-line would respect this kid and try to maneuver around him. But after about 3 or 4 plays, he had always exposed himself and they realized he was the weak link in our line. They'd just start going right at him and he'd go backwards like he was on skates. When he was in the game, the defense knew that every play we ran was going to the other side.

Halfway through the season coach gave up on him and parked him on the bench.

The lesson, to all of you wanna be soccer moms whose sons opt for football: Step aside, and let the coaches make a man out of your boys. You can take the biggest kid on the planet and turn him into a wimp by overprotecting him. Helicopter Moms...you are crippling your kids.",1

A cruise speed of 535 mph and a max speed of 686 mph. Or a speed of Mach .8 or .9. A total of 12 were built.  But they never entered service as the US Navy decided to not use the seaplanes because it‚Äôs mission requirements  basically went away and there was no need for them going forward. Thus their contracts were cancelled and the planes were scrapped. 

A very interesting plane both technically and performance wise.",12
12512,Efrg2RuCXyY,2,Documentary,"Technology documentaries","As a model maker in the early fifties and sixties i looked at this problem of disengaging from the water that effectively was acking tike a glue holding the plane down.
It tries a number of ways to overcome this, and the best way turned out the be able to intruduce air to the area of the step.
I put a bit of tubing blocked off at one end and a small fan that blew diwn the pipe fixed at the bottom of the step.
At rotate speed the air speed was almost enought to allow air to come out of the pipe and disturb the suction that was being produced but the aircraft cutti g its way through the water, l later found that using a syphon bulb for a soda sream was even more effective, as it created pessure between the plane and the sater, actually creating a very quick release, once airborn, 
The air could be shut down.
If using a small compressor the air tank could quickly be refilled and in fact used during landing, which allowed a much finer angle of attack thus making the landing a lot smoother too, i am amaze nobody ever thought of it before as the distance this suction took up of taking off was  something that limited where you could take of from, it certainly shortened the take off distance and made it simpler because the bow wave  was reduced by a cusion of air between the plane and the water.
Just something that may interest people in looking the improve performance and stability of even the biggest and smallest of planes.",2

Olympic National Park was founded in 1938 and is located in the western part of the US state of Washington on the Olympic Peninsula. Since 1976 the national park has also been designated as a UNESCO biosphere reserve. In 1981 UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site. Since the national park is located on a remote peninsula, some animal and plant species have developed here that can only be found here in the park. For this reason, the park is a popular research area for biologists and zoologists.

The national park consists of two separate parts. The coastline is rugged, often shrouded in fog. Inland, the forest connects directly to the beaches, fallen tree trunks often seen lying across the beach. The core area of the park is the mountainous region around the Olympic Mountains, covered by ancient glaciers. To the west of it are temperate rainforests, making the area the wettest area in the contiguous United States.

How in the world do you carry your team, running on fumes, Pippen barely able to walk on a bad back... down 3 with 40 secs left... make a quick driving layup, steal the ball from the MVP on the other end, come back and 'cross up' a guy to make the game winning shot. the shot for the title. 100% responsible for the ending of the game, just snatched the game from the jaws of defeat out of sheer f**king will through 3 straight possessions. Also, please tell me the last time any GREAT player has hit the deciding shot within the last 10 seconds to clinch a finals SERIES. It's something Bird, Magic, Kobe, Wilt, Russell, Kareem, Oscar, Dr. J, Hakeem, Shaq etc etc etc... absolutely NO GREAT PLAYER has EVER done. A game winning finals shot is rare. A series-clinching finals shot is EXTREMELY rare. To have that be the final. f***king. shot. of your CAREER?

for your SIXTH chip? for your SECOND 3-peat? Remember a single 3-peat hadn't been done since Russell's Celtics in an 8 team league. To close off what was ALREADY the greatest career of all time? I know I'm 35 and sound like an old fart talking about this. But young guys born after 1991 will never quite understand the magnitude that was Jordan, his career, and that literally unfathomable, storybook shot. I can understand why young guys get tired of hearing this stuff. Because it sounds completely fake, like something no one can live up to. Fortunately, it ACTUALLY happened. I'm sorry you didn't see it. You will never get it. "The Last Dance" truly doesn't do it justice, doesn't give it its proper perspective.

Michael Jordan is just absurd, it's unbelievable, it's what blew up the NBA to an unprecedented level and also blew up the contracts today.

13997,0Y9IRmUaTvM,2,Documentary,"Science documentaries","I worked as a strategist at the time, researched MS-370, and at that time concluded that it landed at Diego Garcia, and that the plane had it's gM tail number changed, and was shot down over eastern Ukraine as MS-17 on 17Jul2014. I noticed the same girl photographed as one of the mourners after both crashes I thought was interesting.  Later, I realized, that for whatever reason, the US Navy had shot down MS-370 and that I was wrong about it reappearing in Ukraine.  I was questioned about my theory regarding the US involvement in the aircraft's disappearance and warned not to further write about nor discuss it.  There must have been something or someone worth destroying on MS-370.  Later, as debris from MS-370 was found and the satellite "hand-shakes" were analyzed, I did my calculations and they showed that MS-370 probably crashed into the Indian Ocean probably about 1,000 miles west of Perth, Australia into the western part of the Perth Basin or even the Diamentina Deep, 6,000-20,000 feet deep.  All 239 people on board, including Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, who caused the tragedy died, probably before the plane actually crashed.  Maybe someday the truth will come out, but I'll not hold my breath.  "We" have many mysteries that may never be solved. This is one of the most mysterious. ",4

The guy that really was involved with the school projects was an example of how it can also be a good thing.

I respect kuhne for being so honest and I agree with his argument of bureaucracy at the government although not his reasoning (and he reminded me of a sugar uncle I had in his mannerisms)‚Ä¶.cooperation starts with a lending hand. He just does what he likes not what people need. Same for Dieter. The known drive of status or own will (my way or the high way), always conditional (indirect commercially transactional instead philanthropical) not unconditional.

I think you did a good job demonstrating the two main types of "wealthy donors"- those who self promote through their largess and those who seek to fulfill unmet needs and seek little if any personal recognition. Actually all donors are a mix of those two in varying proportions- guilt, family tradition and others can add color. Loved Herr Hochul's trip to the classroom to hear about one of his projects directly from the students; his look of satisfaction in the growth and learning made clear he saw that investment a success. I know this was shot in Germany, but a recent soccer team owner in the UK, Ryan Reynolds, might have been another good choice for a "good" donor.",3

The hospitality I received from all the Australian people I met was more than I could imagine and for a week, the war I had left and would return too was little though about.  To Derrick, the cab driver who spent half a day driving me around and showing me the sights and then refusing to charge me fare I've never forgotten your kindness and have told people often about your generosity .  For Agnes, the terrific blonde who kept me company for the last 5 days of my stay and continued to write me letters after going back to Vietnam, you were a calming presence during that time. I've often wondered about you and wondered how life fared for you. Upon leaving Vietnam for home, it pained me to find out, that the part of my lost property shipped home was the one that contained your address, letters and our pictures.......

I was never really interested in seeing the outback - it just seemed like a heap of sand and nothing to me. Most Australians are coastal people and aren't interested in the interior. I started doing road trips into the outback, and nothing can prepare you for it. It's the best place on earth to do road trips. You can drive for days without seeing a single person and experience true isolation. The sky at night is like nothing you have ever seen. You can clearly see satellites passing over and the milky way looks like a huge cloud. Australia really is two different countries masquerading as one. Our cities are huge and vibrant, but our rural areas and outback are so unspoilt and vast.",10

Their bites are tiny and often painless, with many victims not realizing they have been envenomated until respiratory depression and paralysis begins  No blue-ringed octopus antivenom is available From a history perspective most people do not know how critical Australia in WW2.",6
14533,jldVCbV0usg,2,Documentary,"Science documentaries","Back around 2002 I got the opportunity to visit Australia for free.  My brother had been transferred there with his job and his company paid for his family to come over and visit.  The trip over was interesting.  From KY my flight was delayed for inclimate weather so I missed the only flight that day that leaves from L.A. to Sydney.  That meant they put me up in a hotel and I had to spend the next day sightseeing L.A.  While standing in line for our hotel I met a guy from Germany and we decided to spend our sight seeing day together.  He was an engineer and flew first class while I flew coach.  The main thing I remember about our day together was a conversation we had.  He wanted to know what life was like in the U.S. and asked me lots of questions.  When he asked how big my house was and I told him it was about 1600 sq ft.  Just your ordinary 3br 2ba middle class house.  When I said, 1600 sq ft his jaw dropped open.  I might as well have told him I lived in Windsor Castle.  I wanted to ask him what size house he lived in but was afraid it might embarrass him.  But that made an impression on me about just how prosperous our once great nation is.

Anyway, being in Australia was very interesting.  It was not as easy to understand people speaking as I thought.  Sometimes it wasn't a problem and I could understand them perfectly.  Other times someone might ask me something and I would have to turn to my brother because I simply couldn't understand them.  And then there were times when there were cultural differences in the language.  When we went to a McDonalds for breakfast one morning it was my turn to order.  I said that I would like mine To Go.  The girl behind the counter looked puzzled and finally said, 
"Oh!  You mean 'Take Away' ". 
I said, "Yeah, ok.  Whatever."
Then I said I would like a sausage and egg biscuit.  Another puzzled look.  In Australia a biscuit is what they call a cookie.  She thought I asked for a cookie with my sausage and egg.  
Another time while my bro and I were standing a kind of a long line at a Quick Mart to pay for gas (before the days of pay at the pump) we were all just standing there quietly waiting our turn to pay when I turned to my bro and started talking.  Immediately everyone in line turned around to see the Americans.  I never felt so conspicuous in all my life.
One other observation I made while I was there was the prices of American goods in the stores there.  Everything American; Budweiser, Levi's jeans, and anything else American was three times the price as in America.

But I loved my stay there even though it was only a week.  Will never forget it.",4

14959,8,2,Documentary,"True crime documentaries_TUdHtN7nN","I‚Äôve lived in Charlottesville for over 30yrs. Lived through both Hannah‚Äôs and Morgan‚Äôs disappearances and murders; both heartbreaking cases.  

It was a very scary time especially for young women/girls in the area. My own daughter was a student at UVA from 2011-2015.  I was terrified for her safety. 

I remember the day that over a thousand C‚Äôville residents searched for Hannah. Both my daughter and my sister participated (I had to work that day or I would have been there as well).

It was also terrifying when we learned who the murderer was and that he had lived and worked and gone about his daily life and activities (even volunteering as assistant football coach at a local school!) undetected and among us for so many years!

I was so relieved when he was sentenced to life in prison with NO CHANCE of parole. 

Thank you to the Graham and Harrington families for holding firm and rejecting that first plea deal!  They no doubt have saved the lives of even MORE young women with their actions and insistence on justice for Hannah and Morgan!

I also am very critical of and assign blame to BOTH Liberty University AND Christopher Newport College!  Both schools allowed him to get away with NO ACCOUNTABILITY for the SA‚Äôs he perpetrated on fellow students there. They allowed him to leave quietly instead of reporting his SA‚Äôs to police!!  BOTH of those schools bear some responsibility for the deaths of Hannah and Morgan, imo!

IF Liberty U & Christopher Newport had ACTED RESPONSIBLY and reported him to police, he probably would have already been incarcerated and not walking around freely to assault AT LEAST 3 more women (that we know of/probably even more!) and to murder 2 of them!

Checklist: ‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone

‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff: your laptop/tablet/phone, a few pens, paper or whatever you need.

‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heating pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 

Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book.

If I don't like how one is dressed, it doesn't mean that the other person shouldn't dress how they feel, see in the soul,  not in influence. For example, I like to dress colorfully even though I'm a boy or like a landscape (a costume with clouds), but my mother doesn't like it, she says I'd be some kind of clown and tells me to wear jeans, she  well I don't like it and it doesn't mean that I'm arrogant or other nonsense, and I'm me.

15249,EJU90JyRxIA,4,Lo-fi,"Lo-fi ambient music","To everyone who's studying with this music:

Checklist: ‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone

‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff: your laptop/tablet/phone, a few pens, paper or whatever you need.

‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heating pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 

Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book. 

I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight ",27

It went down his chest and back in strings in some places. He was in Brazil doing research and while swimming one day had one tentacle from a Man a War hit his arm. He felt the pain ,but when he tried to pull his arm away it just pulled the rest of it on to him. He said that it came close to killing him, but during the 3 hour ride to a hospital he said he prayed for death. Said the pain was indescribable. I will say it looked bad.

If there is one thing we can say for sure, it's that gravity isn't altered by how fast something rotates. That is merely the gyroscope effect, which freaks people out because gyroscopes LOOK like they defy gravity, when they do not.
I can easily understand someone working on antigravity, and I can understand if they are deluded into thinking they're onto something.
What is so hilarious about all such claims of anti-gravity is this question: WHERE ARE ALL THE GRAVITY-DEFYING THINGS?

He has spoken to a great number of 'official' scientists who possess advanced degrees in 'niche' or specialist areas and has, therefore, his own 'niche', which is not only the ability to fully comprehend what these experts tell him but to intuitively 'see' how they all fit together and also to 'paint the picture' for the rest of us in a way we can also understand. He's worth a dozen PhD's should he desire them, so when I see a 'niche' PhD airily or contemptuously dismiss him as a mere writer with cranky ideas, I shudder at the closed-mindedness displayed.

16239,S3CLtYgmrsA,2,Documentary,"Technology documentaries","His story about the cave is not the only one....his contemporary, a legendary figure in southeast Asia who met him personally in Italy also had a much earlier mysterious experience in one of the caves in Indonesia. His name was Admiral Hang Tuah, a Bugis native who became a world famous warrior and later became an Admiral of a much renowned Navy that prevented the Mongols, pirates and other invaders from starting upheavals in Southeast Asia merely by its presence since they feared the man in charge. But in his later years as an elderly diplomat, he met Leonardo as Hang Tuah was negotiating a deal to buy Italian-made cannons for the armory of Malacca, the then richest port in Asia, if not the world. Hang Tuah was born in 1432. In his early years as the King's elite bodyguard he went to seek out a mysterious hermit wizard or sorceror who lived in a cave in the mountain called Wirana, to gain knowledge which contributed to his amazing transformation - being the undefeated world class warrior who can speak many tongues including Asian, Arabic and European...and martial art skills and technical as well as advanced knowledge of maritime, military, and some say super-spiritual psychic abilities that somehow as legendary as Da Vinci though they took totally different paths: one we all know as an artist-scientist, a creative thinking genius...but Hang Tuah is a more physical hands on kind of creative thinking person who is more ambassadorial in his later years. He too was a genius having learnt from two master alchemical wizards who were known as Adi Putra and Adi Putra's brother known by his title Sang Persanta Nala...These wizards were said to have knowledge beyond human understanding, multi-lingual, knew the intricacies of the human body, engineering mechanics, chemistry and physics and medicine to heal and enhance longevity. Indeed 500 years ago in Southeast Asia is far different than it is now...some ancient knowledge however were passed on in oral traditions among ancestors of the elites which actually derived from the great lost kingdoms of ancient Sundaland (Sa'ba) and long forgotten by the average natives since the destruction of the world's earliest pyramids and the majestic gold palaces that were demolished and became ancient ruins, either submerged or buried in thick layers of soil...Queen Sa'ba's capital of her empire was completely submerged and the huge expanse of land in the Nusantara became scattered islands stretching from Thailand to the Solomon Islands (hence the name), but of course the western invaders were hunting for the relics and treasures...the gold deep in the region still there of course, but ever since the calamities, succession of occupiers and invaders, either raze pillage or plunder (as it was in the age of sails) but they also try to erase historical facts by displacement and transplant, so that natives no longer have the strong attachment to their ancestry and rich past....there was however a secret movement among the elites to protect the "magical" past, some knowledge that would astound modern scientists, architects doctors and engineers....for eg, gyroscopes, metal forging, navigation by stars, ship and house building without use of rivets and nails, medicinal knowledge that surpassed way beyond modern medicine ...(as it was well known among the alchemists then that every known diseases can be cured by the available plants in the tropical region...in fact (contrary to popular belief, Damascus steel and Japanese art and knowledge of making fine blades actually derived from Southeast Asia...but of course after succession of invaders for centuries including the hundreds of ships of the Red Flag Fleet pirates (that were bought or stolen from local builders) the history was soon modified by the conquerors and much knowledge and skills were lost mainly due to the shutting down of shipyards and trade and of course the control by foreign "empires"....still the only surviving "science/art" left is the martial arts way into the 20th century, ironically thanks to the incessant invasion, it became necessary for such tradition to survive, equipping villagers the life or death knowledge or skill to defend their women and children...this became the huge responsibility of Hang Tuah, which sadly today's folks in the region including the peoples of Phillipines had long forgotten and thus take for granted and not appreciated because many of the scribes and elites went down, or hunted together with the destruction of the kingdoms, the last being the annihilation of minor kings of Indonesia by foreign elements. Nonetheless, Hang Tuah is as famous in this region as Da Vinci is in Europe. Both were way ahead of their time, geniuses, highly skilled creative thinkers and a deep understanding beyond average human comprehension. How is that possible? There is something about what they gained in the caves, from relatively mysterious "teachers" or "super"-beings that were never mentioned or described in detail....it reminds me of the movie Dracula, Star Wars or the biography of prophet Muhammad, or even tales from ancient alchemists who adopted very low profiles and almost gone from peoples' memory, unless you seek the...

There are rumours about mystical mystery schools that were connected to Archimedes and Melchizedek etc...that these "keepers of secrets" travelled the world back then and still maybe wandering as if they have become very long-living mortals.",61

16575,lfIz6JcoRIg,2,Documentary,"True crime documentaries","info on jerrell milton is incorrect....He and his brother were apart of a robbery and murder of 31 year old male.  During the same event there was also an injury to another male, this was back in  2015 and when milton was 12.  He was judicated in juvenile court and the judge sent him to Boys Town in Nebraska .  Midwest has a strict policy that children need to be rehabilitated rather than incarcerated.  I know this because in 2019 my friend was murdered by his 15 year old cousin in Brookings, SD.  He was sent to 9 months of juvenile detention and allowed to go back to Portland Oregon where he is now being charged with 2nd degree murder and a list of 10 other charges. I had had a conversation with the prosecutor at the time and he told me that what happens when children dont have a violent criminal history.  They are not charged as adults.  Regarding Milton he went missing from Boys Town in Nebraska and was seen in Madison, SD (in Lake County) as he has family he was staying with...but ultimately but was found in Minneapolis, MN and arrested.  He is now in jail in Nebraska as of May 2023.    I looked into this story as I lived 30 Minutes from Madison, SD.  I know live in Nebraska and that Milton would have had litterally driven past us to have gotten to South Dakota.  You dont think these things or these children can do this but murder happens at any age, race, religion, sex or intelligence.  I personally believe it has to do with antisocial behavior, lack of parental influance and environment in which they grew up in.  He grew up in a gang related atmposphere in Omaha which I believe made him learn to be sociopathic and has zero empathy. thats my opinion.",5

Whereas Stoner's specifications called for use of the newer conical propellant, the whiz kids changed it to ball powder that was already in supply.
Stoner likewise specified chrome lined chambers and bores, that the whiz kids discarded thinking it to be an unnecessary extravagant expense. 
Just those two government overrides, to ball powder and non-chrome lined chambers and bores. produced carbon fouling that adhered to the 
interior of the weapon, thus creating a jammomatic suicide machine. AK-47s at 100yds. were far more effective over American troops armed with

17296,b-2yJNLggSU,3,Movie,"Action movie trailers","The Lancaster was undoubtedly a suburb aircraft and had capabilities that were unique at the time.
However, I have always believed that it was used incorrectly. It was used to do things that could have been just as easily been done by other aircraft, using it to destroy entire cities just to make sure that SOME of the militarily significant targets in that city were hit.
Britain should have diverted the majority of it's aircraft production to the plane that could hit targets, and hit them hard. The De Haviland Mosquito was cheaper, quicker to build and only need two Merlins instead of four. It's speed at all flight levels meant it could actually find and hit targets with a good chance of escaping unscathed, it only had a crew of two, needed significantly less maintenance and plane for plane could probably do more damage than a Lancaster when comparing where bombs actually landed.

Harris fought the introduction and production of the Mosquito in favour of the 'heavies' when a much smaller force of Lancasters could have been used only for operations that no other aircraft could achieve, the Dam Busters Raid being one and dropping of Tallboys being the obvious other. Lancasters were also ideal as support for army land forces, providing carpet bombing of enemy defensive lines as the 8th Air Force did in Operation Cobra and the Lancaster itself did on D-Day and for Operation Plunder. Using them as city-busters was, to my mind, a waste of an exceptional aircraft. Nearly 600 heavy bombers, including over 300 Lancasters, were used in August 1943 to attack Peenemunde with mixed results where a raid by 500 Mosquitos would have been devastating. 
Even in 1944-45 most Lancaster raids actually relied on Mosquito pathfinders to locate and mark the targets, especially after the introduction of OBOE, due to the need for Lancasters to bomb from high altitude to avoid being shot down.",2

Or at the least death that is inevitable. Your own. I hope it's not changed in the movie so much that it takes away from the songs beauty and melancholy joy.

Checklist: 

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1 liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone

‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.

‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, and your pet so you have a study buddy (if you have one)



Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 



You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book. 



I hope y'all had a good day, if not, that's okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight

I'm embarrassed to say that the only other films in this video that I've seen are UNDERGROUND, SOY CUBA, INVESTIGATION OF A CITIZEN..., and OVERLORD.

18198,QW4RdXw,3,Movie,"21st century best movies_JMN","Over the 30 years since Underground was released and I started my own journey, living across different European countries, settling for the past 2 decades in London and mysteriously finding myself, for the first time in my life, entangled with a number of British film makers, I have rarely met people who are familiar with this film! 

Those who knew and watched Underground are usually in some way connected to the film industry and also been familiar with the other Kusturica films. Emir Kusturica won the Can Festival‚Äôs Best Film Award with his film Times of the Gypsies which was also one of the few films ever made entirely in Romani language. It‚Äôs equally surreal, unique and beautifully made. Apart from a handful of professional actors the entire cast is selected from the regular Romani people with no previous acting experience. 

Between those two films Kusturica managed to make yet another unique film, this time while teaching in Hollywood and it‚Äôs called Arizona Dream. For this yet another interesting story Kusturica was able to bring together an amazing cast of the best Hollywood actors from Jerry Lewis, Jonny Depp, Liv Tyler to Fey Dunaway. The only person that is doing music for Kusturica‚Äôs films is Goran Bregovic but on this occasion Iggy Pop made a significant contribution. Following his collaboration on Arizona Dream Jonny Depp became Kusturica‚Äôs close friend to this very day. As a result Depp became also a regular guest in Serbia where not only he give support to future generations of Serbian film makers but he became an honorary citizen of Serbia. 

Former Yugoslavia, ever since the WWII has been one of the most prolific film producers and with AVALA STUDIOS which were at the time in the league  with MGM in terms of the production quality, capacity to make epic films such as Cleopatra and the extent to which the government directly funded the film industry, pushed for artistic freedom, different genre, cinematographic quality and new ideas. Some of the most surreal ideas were explored in the Yugoslavian cinema over the years and to this day I am convinced that there‚Äôs no country that has such a great and versatile cinema collection and I‚Äôm currently watching again Jorgen Leth Perfect Human! 

Also, the first ever film made in Romani language that won also the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award as the best international film in a foreign language is I even met happy Gypsies directed by Alexander Petrovich. It‚Äôs been presently studied on one of the film studies degrees at the St Martin‚Äôs in London. 

So for those who are not familiar with other Kusturica‚Äôs films, apart from Underground I highly recommend:
Times of Gypsies (in Romani language) 
Arizona Dream (leading Hollywood cast members)

18205,QW4RdXw,3,Movie,"21st century best movies_JMN","Very VERY good list. Underground is one of the last film under Yugoslavia banner before the country was fragmented in several countries, i saw it at the movies, very poetic. Soy Cuba was also known for the longest sequence shot and the special B&W film treatment, saw it in spanish, there are some french actors in it. Investigation‚Ä¶ is a masterpiece in so many levels (Gian Maria Volont√© was in his golden area, music from Ennio Morricone, the Kafka effect‚Ä¶)! The tribe is unique! Thanks for your video, i'll be looking for some of those movies",7

18207,QW4RdXw,3,Movie,"21st century best movies_JMN","Deep Cover is STILL one of my 'go to films'. 
I watch it, at least once a year. 
Great, underappreciated film with a stellar cast and a decent story.
Fishburne and Goldblum were GREAT (this was 1992 so pre-Matrix and pre-Jurassic Park).
In fact, I would say this is one of Jeff Goldblum's best actor outings (his best was Mr. Frost, in my opinion).
Fishburne's work justified his 'subtitle' name change from Larry to Laurence in film credits. 
Think of his 'King of New York' character, given 'free reign over an enpire'. 
Must see if you enjoy either actor.",53

18213,QW4RdXw,3,Movie,"21st century best movies_JMN","Ive seen Underground countless times over the last 20 years since I‚Äôve first seen it - I consider Underground the best film ever made and it‚Äôs certainly my favourite. The scene when Blacky thinks he heard his son and calls out and calls out for him ‚ÄúJovo Sine Moj , Jovane‚Äù then he sees his sons reflection and falls to his death in the well. It just tears my heart out. This whole movie is so bittersweet because in the end they finally have each other but in death. A metaphor for all Jugoslavs. 


A few more great Yugoslav/ Serbian movies that are unmissable are Who‚Äôs Singing Over There, The Dagger, The Hornet, No Man‚Äôs Land, Pretty Village Pretty Flame, Black CatWhite Cat, Life is a Miracle, Promise Me This, Time of the Gypsies, St George Shoots the Dragon, The Trap etc",9

18218,QW4RdXw,3,Movie,"21st century best movies_JMN","One that gets often overlooked is Time of the Gypsies. It's amazing. To me, Before Night Falls is a masterpiece as is The Diving Bell and the Butterfly by Schnabel. Bergman is taken for granted, but imo, Bergman and Kurosawa are the 2 greatest of all time. Prolific and incredible quality. But I also love Kieslowski, especially his trilogy Blue, White and Red. Blue is my fave, but they're all amazing.",10

18221,QW4RdXw,3,Movie,"21st century best movies_JMN","Thanks for this, definitely will check out some of these films.  As an expat Czech I would recommend  Franti≈°ek Vl√°ƒçil. his adaptation of the novel Marketa Lazarov√° is considered by Czech film makers as one of the top Czech films ever made.  The cast actually spent nearly a year living in 13th century like conditions.  Also his Devils Trap and Valley of the Bees are highly recommended.

My enjoyable other films were My LIfe as Dog a 1985 Swedish film by Lasse Hallstr√∂m,  and the Russian Films Days of Eclipse and My Friend Ivan Lapshin. 

another noteworthy film is Close to Eden a 1991 film set in inner Mongolia by Nikita Mikhalkov",3

18225,QW4RdXw,3,Movie,"21st century best movies_JMN","As an Aussie Serb who lived in Yugoslavia as a child, I'm glad you mentioned "Underground" (funny that I think now of it there might have been a bunker near my apartment building in Belgrade - I remember some tunnels that I went down as a young boy but I don't remember that part clearly). Another cool part was when I returned to Belgrade (or as Serbs call it "Beograd"), I saw the film playing on the TV screen at a friend's .
Another Serbian movie you might want to check out is a film I believe is called "Little Village, Little Flame" which is set during the Yugoslavia Wars with a group of Serb soldiers trapped in hostile territory with a dimwitted American journalist and as they spend time under fire, they have flashbacks to their pasts.
My father watched it on cable TV.

Checklist: 

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone

‚Ä¢ a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.

‚Ä¢Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 



Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it's cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. 



You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that's even better than listening to music while reading the book.

Today  I am a little happy polar bear living in armony and satisfied with myself, producing and selecting music. Once again thanks for sharing your music and for being an amazing source of inspiration and support during the difficult times. Wish you the best. 
Thankful to you.

19394,iEGFFyv0MH4,4,Lo-fi,"Lo-fi hip-hop beats","I just got a big wave of nostalgia from 5:08. When I studied abroad in Japan last year, I remember walking along this one street in Kyoto to go to three specific places: the Tsutaya (to study/do homework), Sushi Ro, and Mos Burger. This song really takes me back to when I'd walk past Tambaguchi Station at night, when all these streetlamps were lit up. People passed by, but not many. I remember sitting in Mos Burger, most times by myself, but sometimes with a friend or two. I usually got chicken nuggets with mustard sauce, and a hot milk tea. It was kind of eerie being in there by myself at night, but it was peaceful. On another note, whenever we'd all go to Sushi Ro, the little sushi plates rolling down the conveyor-belt under the neon lights always looked so cool. Just...all the food in Japan was sooo good. (I could talk about a lot more foods, but that would take up a lot of space lol.)",39

19440,9by72PbEiZE,4,Lo-fi,"Lo-fi hip-hop beats","To everyone who's studying with this lofi mix, here's a little checklist:

‚Ä¢ A bottle of water. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate 

‚Ä¢ Your charger. You sometimes don't even notice that your device's battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time 

‚Ä¢ Your headphones. You will be able to focus more
with headphones because it blocks background noises. Also, if it's a late night study session, you won't wake up anyone 

‚Ä¢ Tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well 

‚Ä¢ Your study/work stuff: your laptop/tablet/ phone, 
a few pens, paper or whatever you need 

Remember to take breaks whenever you need along with moving your body around a bit so you're not always sitting! Have a beautiful day/night ",9

19555,RxhDx1gpoeo,1,Sports,"athletics top moments","Very entertaining, one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected.  I remember my wife was given a free ticket to a Diamondbacks game, which went zero/zero so she finally left and when she came home she said "I got bored with the game".  The Diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left, winning the game.  

I teased her endlessly after that, suggesting she should not attend more D-backs games, and they went on to win the world series that year, my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the Yankees and Luis Gonzalez base hit that won the game.

I met Joe Montana, and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl, and I saw the ending in French, in Montreal, in '90.   During my flight from SFO to Toronto and the connecting flight to Montreal, our Air Canada pilot gave us updates on a one-sided blowout.

I also will never forget the Stanford/Cal game in 82 and "The Play" when Cal beat Stanford, and the band became part of the game.  Some still argue over two of the lateral passes, but the win for Cal was as it was, and I still say, that is among the craziest moments in sports history.

My own crazy moment was when I was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team, even though I was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team, the school we played had no players above the sixth grade, so I agreed.  We won the game, though I had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game.  Adrenalin had me psyched, and our QB said I threw perfect spirals.  I would intimidate the bigger players since they feared I'd plow under them and stop them from getting to the QB, and they never did, he was not sacked.

Our team went on to win the Norcal championship, undefeated, in our twelve team league, my brother playing as wide receiver, though I no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders.  I never went on to play in high school, feeling I was too small to be as good as I was in my grammar school game, where I also played on the defense, and I stuck to distance cycling and golf, both of which I enjoyed and also had many "crazy" moments, and I was decent at the 440 as it was then, now the 400 meters.

Even in my early 60's now, and despite a leg I broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago, I still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing.

On my channel here @Cactus521 I even have a video of me jumping off the Vegas Stratosphere tower when I was 52, though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered, I felt peace, and not fear, on the way down, choosing that vs. skydiving as my free fall bucket list item, since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane.

About 20 seconds later, the guy sitting a few rows back with a small radio started laughing.  We turned around and he said, while still laughing, that the commentators on the radio said the ball bounced off of his head.

After the game, we raced home so that we could catch the sports highlights on the local news.  We got home in time and laughed our asses off.  This is a memory that my Dad and I won't ever forget.",428

Worlds richest country

Awarding Qatar the 2022 World Cup probably is the single most important event to happen to this tiny country ever. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not going well but first things first. 

It took our team a year to get an interview with one of the richtest entrepreneurs. If you already live in the richest country in the world, that‚Äôs pretty darn loaded. 

The guy trades in luxury goods. The emir of Qatar personally grants trading rights to deal in various businesses. This guy got the rights to deal in watches, cars, yachts etc. Goes without saying, he owns some serious bling. His house: the size of three footfall fields and not to be found on any map. He owns 80 cars worth 100 million dollars. Most of them Ferrari‚Äôs. ‚ÄòNuff said.  

What we also know about Qatar: they treat the laborers building the stadiums for the 2022 World Cup like slaves. Amnesty International has reported on their horrendous living and working conditions. Living conditions comparable to the worst prisons, pay barely enough to send home, passports confiscated. 
What is particularly egregious: it‚Äôs  happening in the richest country on earth. Our team tries to find their own answers, gets mostly varnished propaganda. 


The best mystery place this week is an absolute gem  
Santo Stefano di Sessanio in Italy üáÆüáπ 
The village in the province of L‚ÄôAquila in the Abruzzo region of Southern Italy was abandoned for 50 years.  With much love and some 10 million dollars, new life has returned. It‚Äôs been turned into a hotel complex. And it‚Äôs bringing the entire village back to life. People have been moving back. And the way it‚Äôs being done is exemplary: organic and sustainability everywhere; no plastic used anywhere. 

Everything is sourced  regionally. Traditions from the past reawakened. Coffee is served traditionally. That means no steaming espresso machines. We are given a demonstration how Italian coffee used to be made.

This place should definitely go on your list if you want to gently travel back in time; getting a feel what life was like in a remote Italian village, in sun drenched streets, with esprit italiano.  

Ramstein Germany üá©üá™ 
It‚Äôs a fairly well know Military Airbase 
17,000 soldiers live there and is the hub for or when 
troops are transported to conflict areas. A US military base is basically a slice of US life uprooted and replanted in other countries. Everything is in $, all the products and food and free time activities are exactly what you‚Äôd find anywhere in the US. Only you are on a piece of land in Germany or South Korea or the Middle East. Wherever the troops are stationed..home away from home. 

Indonesia üáÆüá© 
Deep in the Indonesian jungle stands a Chicken Church. All faiths welcome.  Poor, rich, vegetarian or chicken eaters. The Chicken Church is open to all. The Owner gives a tour. A smaller gem  in the forest of Mystery Places. 


Moscow, Russia üá∑üá∫ 
What lies underneath is where it‚Äôs at. At least in this episode. Life underground. Not subway underground. Sewage etc underground. Sergei takes us down down down into what lies underneath a big city. 

We begin with an obscenely rich guy to the desolate and forgotten. 

Mystery Places of our World. Always an adventure. 

Enjoy!

Director: Ang Lee
Starring: Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

Ang Lee's "Brokeback Mountain" is a masterpiece that defies expectations and transcends genres. Adapted from Annie Proulx's short story, the film follows the forbidden love between two cowboys, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), as they navigate the complexities of their relationship against the backdrop of 1960s Wyoming.

What sets "Brokeback Mountain" apart is its unflinching portrayal of love in its most raw and authentic form. Ledger and Gyllenhaal deliver breathtaking performances, immersing themselves completely in their roles and capturing the tumultuous emotions of their characters. Ledger's portrayal of Ennis, a stoic and emotionally guarded man, is particularly poignant, as he grapples with his feelings for Jack amidst societal pressures and personal struggles.

The film's cinematography is equally captivating, with sweeping vistas of the Wyoming landscape serving as a backdrop to the intimate moments shared between Ennis and Jack. The natural beauty of the setting contrasts with the internal conflict faced by the characters, highlighting the dichotomy between their private desires and the harsh reality of their circumstances.

At its core, "Brokeback Mountain" is a love story that transcends boundaries of gender, sexuality, and societal norms. It challenges viewers to confront their own prejudices and biases, urging them to empathize with characters who are forced to hide their true selves in order to conform to societal expectations. In doing so, the film becomes a powerful commentary on the human experience and the universal desire for acceptance and connection.

Despite the tragic nature of its narrative, "Brokeback Mountain" ultimately leaves viewers with a sense of hope and redemption. It reminds us that love knows no bounds and that true happiness can be found in the most unlikely of places. Ang Lee has crafted a timeless masterpiece that will continue to resonate with audiences for generations to come.",2

20655,1oiJqE3OI,2,Documentary,"Technology documentaries_g","SUMMARY OF THIS VIDEO
The video "The World in 2050: The Real Future of Earth" presents a possible scenario for how the world may look in the year 2050. It discusses various trends and predictions related to population growth, urbanization, climate change, technology, and geopolitics.

The video suggests that the world population may reach 9.7 billion by 2050, and that most people will live in urban areas. It also predicts that climate change will continue to be a major challenge, with rising temperatures, sea levels, and natural disasters affecting many parts of the world.

In terms of technology, the video suggests that advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, and biotechnology may transform many aspects of society, including transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. However, it also warns of potential risks and ethical concerns associated with these technologies.

The video also discusses the changing geopolitical landscape, with the rise of China and other emerging economies potentially challenging the dominance of the United States and other Western powers.

Overall, the video presents a vision of a complex and rapidly changing world in 2050, with both opportunities and challenges that will require creative and collaborative solutions",25

Isn't it similar to making more roads and making them wider? Like, if you do it, you increase car-travel efficiency and thus move the equilibrium point farther from public transportation. It means more people going by cars and soon there will be even more traffic then before (but very efficient traffic, great)
What actually could be done to move the equilibrium point to public transport (which is much more efficient) is optimizing public transportation schemes, while getting rid of car roads (think about it in terms of equilibrium for a moment). But it's not commercially profitable, so you won't hear this idea from Nokia -- listen to scientists",45

It's such a brilliant idea that I'm thinking we need this in my home. You see, my family has been very conscious about our water consumption and we have some rules to follow. For example, we have the three pile rule for the toilet. That means we can only flush after three people have used it. We also reuse our toilet paper by washing it and drying it. This is possible because we eat a Earth-friendly fiber-rich foods that make our bowel movements very easy to wash clean. We hardly need any water to rinse the toilet paper and we can use it again and again. 
But now I realize that there is a better way to save water and be environmentally friendly. This shower system is the perfect solution for us. We can shower as long as we want without wasting any water. We can also use the same water for other purposes, like washing the toilet paper. It's genius!
Of course, I'm just joking. I don't really do any of those things. I just wanted to make you laugh.

21451,4cb-DeDG884,2,Documentary,"True crime documentaries","Maybe she was expecting "Life in Prison" or at least 25/30 yrs and after that get paroled?? As a true crime fan, I think in America there are so many gruesome crime where the culprit or culprits deserves  death penalty but instead they usually get life, where they still get the chance of living a life and getting old even in a prison while their victims don't. I think there should be a line regarding their crime, where the murdrer should get death penalty or life in prison. When I see a crime, where I use to think the murderer (male/female) will surely get a death penalty but instead they get a life and there is a crime where I think he/she would get life in prison but gets death penalty. When I say a death penalty, I used to think, the person (he/she) would be put to death in a year at least but even given death penalty, they still had the time to get old, see the world from inside a prison. This surely isn't fair to the victim/victims families. To me, if death is given, it should be done at least in a year, not more than that. Sometimes, I don't really understands the judiciary systems in America. After seeing so many documentary regarding prison around the world, American prison is like a heaven to prisoners. American prisoner can eat delicious food, they can take exercise, can play basket ball,  library to read books and can even get their GED in prison. American prison isn't rough regarding other prisons in different countries....if I'm not wrong.",21

Plus he's extremely smart and he's willing to think outside of the box, which many of these others refuse to do. And people who think outside the box are usually the ones who make the greatest discoveries. So I do believe that Hancock will be vindicated in the upcoming decades. I just feel bad that he may not be around to witness it because of his age. But here's to hoping that Graham does live a long and frutiful life and gets to see it.

I guess those who think everyone on board were either rescued or recovered must think that every person on board were standing outside on one of the many decks.

Have they never heard of recovery missions where divers have to dive inside the vessel to retrieve bodies moving them outside the vessel and send them up to the surface?

Yeah, the Templars had plenty of gold in their time, but the largest part of their wealth was tied up in land and other businesses. Like all smart businessmen, the Templars knew that you don't build wealth by sitting on a pile of gold like the dragon in LOTR. You build wealth by putting that gold to work for you. You use it to finance commercial ventures - shipping companies, farms, flour mills and bakeries, wineries, textiles etc. 

They also didn't keep as much cash on hand as people imagine because they lent out vast sums of it, including to deadbeat kings who p*ssed it away on wars, gambling and mismanagement which is what led one king to destroy the order when he couldn't repay. The Templars also had to spend a lot of money just to keep the order running. Even though the knights themselves didn't get a salary or shareholder profits, it still took a lot of money to pay its regular workers, feed everybody, maintain a military force etc. I don't think there is really any vast horde of gold and gems waiting to be found. It's a fun dream, but little more than that.",3

When Prince Henry Sinclair sailed to North America in 1398, he commanded 17 Templar Ships, with the Zeno brothers navigating. (see the "Zeno Narrative". If they should find any Templar treasure beneath Oak Island, It won't be much more than 10% of the treasure... They were too smart to leave it all in one location... The Kensington Runestone should give you a hint. Prince Henry Sinclair was made Earl of Orkney by the King of Norway. Sinclair became fluent in Norwegian. That's a long story, in itself... Anyway, the bulk of the treasure is hidden elsewhere... Keep looking... lol Btw, there are organizations who were privy to that knowledge. However, they are under an oath of silence... Have fun... lol",0
23458,IKBdV3BS9Xs,2,Documentary,"History documentaries","Greater mysteries of the Holy Land, Europe, Wales, and the Americas opens up new discoveries.  In 1170, (the said reason for) the Welsh Prince Madog of Wales was the internicene warfare for the rulership of northern Wales (Gwynnedd).  While it is admitted for Ireland, that the Norse and Vikings came into Northern Ireland (Finngails) and Dublin (Dughgails), it is lesser said that northern Wales was also (invaded) colonized and settled by the Norse.

NORSE ! (-Irish) Saint Brendan and 16 missionaries sailed to the Americas in a (Norse) longboat of 8 oxhides length (~50 feet).  Why did these missionaries go to the Americas - unless they were going to settle missions and convert the American populations to Celtic Church christianity ??? !!!

NORSE ! Leif Ericsson sailed in the 1000s to the Americas, and (it is now known) that his 4 colonies IN NOVA SCOTIA were established in Halifax glacial bay fjord (Leifsbudir), St Margarets Bay glacial bay fjord (Stormsfuror), MAHONE BAY 300+ islands (hint Oak Island) glacial bay fjord (Wonderstrands, Wonderful beaches), and Bay of Fundy glacial bay fjord (Hopm French Port Royal, British Annapolis,

Then in 1170 Welsh Prince Madog sailed with a colony to the Americas.  Some say they eventually settled into the greater Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee area ... and descendants would be part of the Mandan blue eyes, blonde haired native peoples.  He is said to have had this and 2 other sailings, in which in the 1180s was his last sailing, and last contact with the Old World.  BUT ! ... there is more !

The Fall of Jerusalem, the Kingdom of Outreimer, happened in 1178.  All movements of people out of Jerusalem, and the start of out-migrations of peoples, would move to the Templar stronghold and trading hub of Acre, along the Mediterranean and Asian Silk Route.  Any peoples, including the treasury of Jerusalem, would have sailed out of Jerusalem, and if they were part of the Templar Fleet operating in the area, then this Fleet would have NOT NECESSARILY have stopped at Rome, and given up the treasury, but continued to sail to the British Isles, away from the catholic French and Italian Kings and Pope.


This leads to a strong suggestion that part of Welsh Prince Madog's designs were part in establishing further Templar colonies in the Americas, but also meet up with his prior colonies (and those of earlier colonies of the Norse) who were already in direct contact with the transAtlantic Templar Fleet of Europe and the Americas.  This portion of the 1170-1180s would be before the (now established) settlement and construction of the Oak Island harbor stone roadways of the 1220s, with possible implied Portugues pro-Templars (Spanish Inquisition catholic anti-Templars) and such expat Portuguese and French Basques moving to the Americas, building these roadways, mines, tunnels, etc.

With the Templars, as part of the earlier Solomon Fleet, just the name changed as part of the extended Celtic Church organization, they would have already been there before Saint Brendan, Leif Ericsson, ... and with the first of the Templars settling at Oak Island and creating a massive military defense complex, and business, industrial, and craft enterprise economic system there from 1096 onwards.

If anything was Templar from Jerusalem (1096-1178), and the Knights Templar holding the Temple Mount and digging all through and around the hill, this would be the period in which transferring such ancient relics and treasuries would be removed via the Templar Fleet into European and British Isles Templar strongholds, away from the catholic rulers and pope.  Such would be this period in which these ancient artifacts would have been buried at Oak Island ... and the massive rise of the Celtic Church and Templar organization, with royals, nobles, churches, monasteries, trade organizations, international banking systems spanning Scandinavia, the Baltics, Russia, Germany, France, Italy, Byzantium, British Isles, Spanish/Portuguese sub-continent, and portions of North Africa sailing and trading posts, ... alongside all of the interim Mediterranean islands of Malta, Crete, Cyprus, Sicily, etc.

So Welsh Prince Madog and his NORSE-Welsh expats, along with such Templar warriors, Templar families, and Celtic Christians would have sailed to the Americas with a large fortune of Templar treasure to the Americas.

It is also part of the Eastern seaboard of North America, that the Solomon Fleet turned Templar Fleet would have sailed up/down the entire coastline of the Canadian Maritimes down to Central America of the Mayan Empire (and beyond ?) with trade goods.  It is known that the Mayans would buy up blue clay (known to be on Oak Island) and pay with tumbaga gold (gold, silver, and copper mixed) ingots.  Here is another source of the Templar treasury of Oak Island, and the very reasons why the Templars became financially strong, secure, and of vast power from the Americas back into Europe and the Old World.  

Other export markets were established, especially black gunpowder (carbon powder, sulfur, saltpeter - all made on Oak Island),  Lead and iron musket, falconette ship mini-cannons, and cannon balls of the 1200s (lead and iron on Oak Island).  Bronze (copper and zinc) and brass (copper and tin) could also make pistols, rifles, and other militaria.  Copper of the Great Lakes or the Mayan tumbaga copper, alongside of zinc and tin known to be mined on Oak Island.  Shipbuilding of shallow coastal or deepwater fishing fleets, as well as Templar Fleet trading and military ships would easily be made on the island.  So many other craft products could also be made (which were critical items in the Old World, even up into the 1500s) which Oak Island was secure from Old World intrigues, and still have the Templar Fleet and the Celtic Church strong up to 1534.

The more you understand Oak Island and its connections with the historical events of the Old World, and the Fall of Acre in the last 10th Crusade, you see the Templars with their treasuries of gold, silver, copper, and sailing back westward, ... and with catholic intrigues of the French king and Roman Pope, they would have moved their treasuries back up into Germany, Lowlands, Teutonic Empire of Prussia/Poland, and into the British Isles ... and then eventually move to the Americas.",1

23464,IKBdV3BS9Xs,2,Documentary,"History documentaries","As a direct male descendant of (Lord Robert VI of Carrick) King Robert I of Scotland, it was his father Lord Robert V of Carrick, who was in the 10th (and last) Crusade, and the fall of Acre and the Golden Tower of the Templars.  That refugee fleet in the 1290s would have clearly be enticed to go to Scotland, and away from the French/Italian/Spanish catholic nations, including the English catholic nation and go to independent Scotland, and take up residency and Scottish citizenship - of warriors, sailors, bankers, administrators, court officials (royal courtiers), international traders, ambassadorial staffs, .... 

The ancestry of King Robert is an ENTIRE Templar ancestry of the greater Celtic Church and Templar family-clan church who migrated out of the Holy Land and the Continent into Scotland (and were given lands and powers by King Malcolm and David I in those 1100s-1200s).

The real treasure of the Templars would be found in Scotland, and eventually relocated, after the 1307 French-Italian Inquitision, then the 1311+ English Inquisition, the Templars and the prior Jewish harassments (and attempted gold and silver confiscations by the Kings) in these nations, would have moved families, equity, and any other Templar national bank funds into Scotland.

It is easily known that the 900s-1100s Norse (Leif Ericsson) settled colonies (not as modern said L'Ans Aux Meadows) but at Leifsbudir (Halifax and Benson Bay glacial fjord, Stormsfuror (St Margarets Bay and Tolland), Wonderstrands (wonderful beaches, Mahone Bay and its 300+ islands, and then Hop (Bay of Fundy, prior French Port Royal, later British Annapolis).

The Templars as part of a whole transAtlantic trade between the Old and New World, and up/down the eastern seaboard of the Canadian Maritimes, North America, and down to Central America and that of the Mayan Empire, would have already been to the Americas - as the Solomonic Fleet (1000s BCE-1100s CE) turned into the Celtic Church and Templar organization).  Any treasures that are known would be buried in those earliest of (newly dated) 1220s of the harbor construction, and mining of natural resources for trade (blue clay to Mayans, red/orange/yellow clays, iron, lead, tin, zinc, sulfur, sand for glassmaking, pottery, ceramics, and so much more) ... and the start of the military defense complex with business and craft industries (and massive population of work forces) on the island, making copperware, silverware, pewter, bronze, brass, iron, ... and military weapons ... and shipworks of coastal and deep water fishing fleets, and military ships.

The real story of Oak Island lies between the 1000s BCE (Solomon Fleet) up to 1762 (harbor bay explosion) wiping out the population and industries on the island.  Any 1762 (mapping of the island for singular subsistence farming lots) - 1795 when all mining stopped, and the 1780s appearance of the British Loyalists shoved out of the Colonies up to Nova Scotia and setting at/near/on Oak Island started the rest of the whole Oak Island treasure (many false) legends.

The real treasure history of Oak Island happens during the Templar era (1096-early 1300s) and the earliest of harbor infrastructure, industries, true mining out the quarry regions of the harbor area, then the mining into the Lot 15/16 area of the eastern drumlin.  It would be these oldest of the mines, tunnels and cul de sacs in which the oldest of the Templar treasures would have been stored, while younger mining and tunneling would have continued further mined natural resources for profits (limestone, gypsum, slate and zinc (western drumlin), iron sulfur pyrite (fool's gold), bluestone/greenstone/greywacke milling and grinding stones, and so much more.

All this labor force needed food (hunting, trapping, and bay/ocean fishing), but also clothing.  Growing garden vegetable crops and grain fields for humans and livestock, ... and also meadows of fiber crops (textiles, fabrics) provided internal production, but also export products.

The greatest treasure of Oak Island is its real history (and demise) ... and what truly remains underground of the eastern drumlin (as has been told for 8+ years to the Laginas in private communications).",2
